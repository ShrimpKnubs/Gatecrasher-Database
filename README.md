In the Beginning, There Was Kelp,

And lo, in the primordial depths of Arma, there Kelp Arose, the First Reforger, who dwelt in the abyss where the light of good ops did not yet shine. 

And Kelp spake, saying, "Let there be ops," and there were opsâ€”but they were as an ass, wrought with chaos and sqf erros, and the servers did tremble. 

Yea, Kelp did forge with hands unskilled, and the scripts were as tangled as the weeds of the deep, and the errors did multiply upon the face of the clients. 

And the players cried out, "Why hast thou forsaken us, O Kelp, with these forsaken deployments?" But Kelp hearkened not, for Kelp was busy refactoring the same broken script for the seventh time. 

And thus, the age of Kelp was marked by toil and woe, and the elders did say, "Surely, this is the darkest of timelines." Yet, from the ashes of Kelp's misdeeds, there emerged a spark of hope, the end of the operation glistening on the horizon.
